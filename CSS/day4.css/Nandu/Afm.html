<h2>Afm</h2>
<pre>
Key aspects of AFM:
High Resolution:
AFM can achieve resolution at the atomic level, far exceeding the limitations of optical microscopes. 
Versatility:
AFM can be used to study a wide range of materials, including polymers, ceramics, composites, and biological samples. 
Force Measurement:
AFM can measure forces between the tip and the sample, including mechanical, magnetic, and electrical forces. 
Modes of Operation:
AFM can operate in various modes, such as contact mode, non-contact mode, and tapping mode, each suited for different types of measurements. 
Applications:
AFM is used in diverse fields, including materials science, biology, and genetics, for applications like studying protein structures, cell membranes, and material properties. 
How it works:
1. Tip and Cantilever:
AFM uses a sharp tip attached to a cantilever, a tiny beam that bends or deflects in response to forces from the surface. 
2. Scanning:
The tip is scanned across the surface of the sample, and the deflection of the cantilever is measured by a laser beam and a photodiode. 
3. Force Detection:
The deflection of the cantilever is directly related to the force between the tip and the sample. 
4. Image Formation:
By mapping the cantilever deflection across the surface, a 3D image of the sample's topography can be created. 
Advantages over other microscopes:
No need for a vacuum:
Unlike electron microscopes (TEM, SEM), AFM can operate in ambient conditions and even in liquid, making it suitable for studying biological samples in their natural environment.
Minimal sample preparation:
AFM requires less extensive sample preparation compared to electron microscopy.
3D imaging:
AFM provides 3D images, while electron microscopes typically produce 2D images.
