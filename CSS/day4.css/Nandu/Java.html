<h2>Java</h2>
<pre>
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java is widely used for developing desktop applications, web applications, enterprise software, Android mobile applications, and more. 
Here's a more detailed look at Java:
Key Features:
Object-Oriented:
Java is a fully object-oriented language, meaning it organizes code around objects, which encapsulate data and methods. According to Shiksha Online 
Platform Independent:
Java achieves platform independence through the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Code is compiled into bytecode, which can be executed by any JVM on any operating system, making it highly portable. 
Robust:
Java has strong memory management and exception handling, making it a reliable language for developing stable applications. 
Secure:
Java was designed with security in mind, incorporating features like security managers and bytecode verification to protect against malicious code. 
Multithreaded:
Java supports multithreading, allowing for concurrent execution of multiple tasks within a single application. 
Large Ecosystem:
Java has a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools, making it a powerful choice for a wide range of applications. according to The Server Side 
Widely Used:
Java remains a popular language, powering a large number of applications across various industries. 
Uses of Java: 
Web Development: Java is used to build server-side applications, including web applications, using frameworks like Spring and JavaServer Faces (JSF). 
Android Mobile Development: Java is the primary language for developing Android applications. 
Enterprise Applications: Java is widely used for building large-scale enterprise systems, including banking and financial applications. 
Desktop Applications: Java can be used to create standalone desktop applications for various platforms. 
Big Data: Java is used in big data technologies like Hadoop and Spark. 
Internet of Things (IoT): Java can be used to develop software for IoT devices.
